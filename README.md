# Rockstarcoders front end test 

This is a test for Rockstarcoders.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  

## To run the project

First clone the project from github [rc-movie-test](https://github.com/Rigo9119/rc-movie-test).
run ```yarn install``` to install dependencies and after that you can run ```yarn start``` to open the development server.

## Things to improve

Obviously styles could been improved some poster have different sizes, animations could be added to for a smooth transition
and better experience. I think the logic of the data is stable but an instance of axios should have been used, I know the api 
key should have been saved in a safe .env file but in my local env it did not work.

The reason to use Beauty star dependency is because I was wasting to much time trying to do the component and at the end decided 
to use something that has already been done. 

Probablye I would use TypeScript to have a better management of the types that the project has, also I am not really confident with 
my skills with it so I didnt want to risk it.

## If the project was real..... :)

I would implement redux to have a better state management and maybe had a easier way to make the project a little bit more scalable.

## Tech stach

This project is using: 

    React
    React hooks
